# Data-Science Project Making a Prediction Model

For this project I used Python and numerous Python libraries to train a predition model to calculate the probability that a transaction results in a return.
I used Pandas to parse the data and get isolate all the data I would need to train my model. I used Sklearn to scale my training and test data. For my neural network
I used Keras to make the input, hidden, and output layer of my neural network. I, then compiled my neural network and trained it until I got an acceptable accuracy. Finally, 
I put my final prediction in a variable and printed it out.
