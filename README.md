# Neural Network for Prediction - README


This repository contains Python code that demonstrates the implementation of an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for prediction using the Keras library. The neural network is built to predict the likelihood of a purchase being returned based on various input features. The code fetches data from a CSV file, processes it, scales the input features, constructs and trains the neural network, and finally provides predictions on a test dataset.
Libraries Used:

1. pandas: Used for data manipulation and analysis.
2. keras: A high-level neural networks API that utilizes TensorFlow as a backend.
3. sklearn: A machine learning library for various preprocessing tasks and model evaluation.
4. StandardScaler from sklearn.preprocessing: Used for standardizing input features.
5. Sequential and Dense from keras.models: Used for building the neural network architecture.
6. train_test_split from sklearn.model_selection: Used for splitting the data into training and testing sets.

How to Run:

Make sure you have Python 3 installed on your system.
Install the required libraries using the following command:

    pip install pandas keras scikit-learn

Download or clone this repository to your local machine.
Place the train.csv file in the same directory as the assessment.py script.
Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the script and data file.
Run the code using the following command:

    python assessment.py

The code will execute, displaying progress updates and final predictions on the test data.

Code Explanation:
Data is read from the train.csv file and processed to calculate the "MSRP" column.
Relevant columns are selected for further analysis.
Data is split into input values (input_values), predictions (prediction), and an identifier column (first_col).
Data is further divided into training and testing sets using train_test_split.
Input features are standardized using StandardScaler to ensure consistent scaling across all features.
A feedforward neural network is constructed using the Sequential model. It has two hidden layers with ReLU activation and one output layer with sigmoid activation. The model is compiled with the adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss, and accuracy is monitored as a metric. The model is trained on the training data using the fit function. Predictions are generated on the test data using the trained model. The final predictions are printed to the console.

Please note that this code is a basic example for educational purposes and might require additional optimizations and enhancements for real-world applications.
